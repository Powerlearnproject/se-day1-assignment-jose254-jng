Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is a branch of computer science that deals with systematic application of engineering principles to the design,development,testing,deployment and maintenance of software systems.
Importance of sosftware engineering
reliability-it ensures software perfoms as expected without bias.
efficiency-it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaning high quality standards.
scalability-it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performancce.
security-implement protection practice like authetication,authorization and encryption to secure users information.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering complexity
mastering process 
mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning-identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
requirement analysis-identify the final user specification.
design-building the framework.
coding-converting software design into tangible code.
testing-examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology-linear and sequential,each phase is completed before moving on.
-there is low flexibility,changes are hard to incorporate 
 once a phase is complete..
 -customer feedback comes late,after the product is developed.
 -testing is done at the end of the development process.
 agile methodology-iterative and incremental,with multiple cycles(sprints).
 -high flexibility,adapts to changing requirements.
 -regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.
 -testing is continuos and done after each interaction.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
-maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
-reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer-collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
-create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow.
-confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment.
-analyse the product to idenify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient.
-develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager-assembles and lead the software development team.
-discuss the project and it`s requirement with the client and software developers.
-create blueprint for the project.
-tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
-deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its perfomance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write,compile, and debug code,sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce the development efforts.eg Visual Code Studio(VSCode)
importance
.Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured.Because IDE knows these rules,it contains many intelligent features 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
