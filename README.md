# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is a branch of computer science that deals with systematic application of engineering principles to the design,development,testing,deployment and maintenance of software systems.
Importance of sosftware engineering
reliability-it ensures software perfoms as expected without bias.
efficiency-it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaning high quality standards.
scalability-it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performancce.
security-implement protection practice like authetication,authorization and encryption to secure users information.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering complexity
mastering process 
mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning-identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
requirement analysis-identify the final user specification.
design-building the framework.
coding-converting software design into tangible code.
testing-examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
