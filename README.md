Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is a branch of computer science that deals with systematic application of engineering principles to the design,development,testing,deployment and maintenance of software systems.
Importance of sosftware engineering
reliability-it ensures software perfoms as expected without bias.
efficiency-it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaning high quality standards.
scalability-it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performancce.
security-implement protection practice like authetication,authorization and encryption to secure users information.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering complexity
mastering process 
mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning-identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
requirement analysis-identify the final user specification.
design-building the framework.
coding-converting software design into tangible code.
testing-examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology-linear and sequential,each phase is completed before moving on.
-there is low flexibility,changes are hard to incorporate 
 once a phase is complete..
 -customer feedback comes late,after the product is developed.
 -testing is done at the end of the development process.
 agile methodology-iterative and incremental,with multiple cycles(sprints).
 -high flexibility,adapts to changing requirements.
 -regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint.
 -testing is continuos and done after each interaction.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
-maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
-reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
Quality Assurance Engineer-collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
-create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow.
-confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment.
-analyse the product to idenify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient.
-develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project Manager-assembles and lead the software development team.
-discuss the project and it`s requirement with the client and software developers.
-create blueprint for the project.
-tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
-deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its perfomance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDE is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write,compile, and debug code,sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce the development efforts.eg Visual Code Studio(VSCode)
importance
.Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured.Because IDE knows these rules,it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
.An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic,or by using different font colours.
.An IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
.IDEs increase programer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of code change
VCS-are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
Examples of VCS are;collaboration,change tracking,branching and merging,error recovery.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
Solution:adopting continuos learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends,keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.
-Time constraints-Software engineering is a demanding and time-intesive field,often requiring engineers to work under high pressures to meet tight deadline.
Solution:Adopt agiles methodologies,such as scrum,to streamline workflows by diving large projects in manageable sprints.
-Limited Infrastructure-limited high perfomance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures.
Solution:Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
-Software security-Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task.
Solution:research ways to defend against hacking,malware,phishing,insider and third-party threats.
-Software Accessibility and Usability-Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users.
Solution:Use scalable architecture,emphasize reliability.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit tests-Are close to the source of an applicatioan,they consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes,components,or modules used by your software.
Importance:it ensures tht each units performs its intended function correctly isolated from other components.
-Intergrated tests-Verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
Importance:Help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
-System test-Focus on the entire software system as a whole,including all fuctionalities and interactions.
Importance:It helps to verify that the system meets all fuctional and non-fuctional requirements,including perfomance,usability and security.
-Acceptance tests- Are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requierements.
Importance:Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2:Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience-Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models` training data.
Increased flexibility- A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neautral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
Developer control-Prompt engineering gives delelopers more control over users'interactions with AI.Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large languagae models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear,specific,and concise.Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Draw a picture of a person.
Draw a full-body potrait of a young woman with long brown hair,wearing a red jacket and blue jeans,standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.


Importance of an improved prompt:
Clarity:The improved prompt specifies what is being asked(
